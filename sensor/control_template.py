#Description:
'''This is a template file to be used when adding new sensors to the openreactor.
The website pulls data from both the sensor table and the sensorreading table
in the sqlite3 database to create the graphs. So in order to add a new sensor
you will need to get the data from the sensor, populate the sensor database
with a name and unit for every reading, and put the datetime, sensor name, and
value of the reading in the sensorreading table of the database.
e.g. "Generic-Sensor Temperature" for the name and "Â°C" for the units in the
sensor table; and "datetime" for the date, "Generic-Sensor Temperature" for the
name, and a numer for the value in the sensorreading table. Look through this
file and its comments to follow how the methods imported from model.py are used
to achieve this. If more reference is needed, SoilSensorReadOnly.py is in this
same directory, and is just this file edited for use with
an adafruit_circuitpython_seesaw sensor. One last thing to note (if you are
still indeed reading this) is that you will need to have a sensor entry for
every value that you wish to store. That is why I formatted the sensor names
like "Generic-Sensor Temperature" as (for many sensors) they can read multiple
values in, so you would need to add another sensor to the database named
"Generic-Sensor [name of other thing being measure e.g. Moisture]" to be able
to properly graph and store the data.'''
